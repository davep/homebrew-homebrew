# davep/homebrew

My [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tap repository for various projects that I'm
making easier to install view Homebrew. If you want to install anything
provided here first do:

```sh
brew tap davep/homebrew
```

and then install the package you're after. Packages that have formula here
will also document this process in their own README.
